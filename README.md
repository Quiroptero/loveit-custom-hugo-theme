Notice: I no longer use this set of adjustments.
Instead, I have forked the LoveIt theme.

---

This repo contains a series of customizations on the [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) Hugo theme,
which I currently use on [my developer site](https://omiranda.dev)
via a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/)
in the [source code](https://github.com/Quiroptero/omiranda-source).
