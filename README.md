This repo contains a series of customizations on the [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) Hugo theme, which I currently use on [my personal website](https://omiranda.dev) via a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) in the [source code](https://github.com/Quiroptero/omiranda-source).
